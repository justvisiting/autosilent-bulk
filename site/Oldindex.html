<p><b>Auto Silent</b></p>
Auto silent app is creating lot of buzz as it provides features which iPhone (even 3GS) is seriously lacking. It puts your phone into silent mode (or changes phone settings according to user config) autmoatically during meetings and in night. This is very much liked by business community and they are jailbreaking their phone to get this app.

<h3>How to make and sell paid app through Cydia <span class="date"></span></h3>
<p>You need to go through complex set of procedures to create and sell the paid app on Cydia. Unlike iTunes

where Apple takes care of all payment, distribution and making sure that only paid app runs on the 

phone, Cydia does not provide any mechanism for that. App developer has to make sure and verify that

the app is a paid app, circumvent illegal distribution and make it secure. 

iPhone packers has come up with innovative solution, you don't need to do anything. Just send an request 

for the paid app. Packers team will send you a piece of code to include in your app. 
Voila You are DONE!!! </p>
<p>&nbsp;Packers team will take care of payment, 

hosting and making sure that only paid users are able to run the app. Contact 
<a href="mailto:sales@iphonepackers.info?subject=Paid App Cydia">iPhonePackers 
team </a> for more info. </p>
