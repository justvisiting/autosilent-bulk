<h3>How to make and sell paid app through Cydia <span class="date"></span></h3>
<p>Unlike iTunes where Apple takes care of all payment, distribution and making 
sure that only paid app runs on the phone, Cydia does not provide any such mechanism. 
App developer has to go through complex set of procedures to make sure a) the 
app is legitimate while running, which requires server side integration, b) 
integrate with Cydia payment gateway to verify whether user has paid for the 
license and if there is trial version then possibly integration with another 
payment system so that license can be bought from app itself. </p>
<p>Following are the steps after developing the app you need to go through to 
sell paid app:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Integrate with payment gateway. Cydia takes care of the payment when an 
	app is downloaded but does not verify whether an app is a paid app when it 
	is installed or run. Anyone could circumvent payment step and download the app 
	directly from the hosted server. In order to get around the problem, app 
	developer has to make sure that the app is paid when it is run. For this, 
	you need to go through set of steps to integrate with Cydia payment gateway 
	and might take few weeks. </li>
<li>Another problem is how to stop the distribution. Once a user downloads the 
app, he can assemble all the bits and pieces and distribute for free. App 
developer needs to make sure the app cannot be redistributed or phone home. 
	</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Packer team has come up with innovative solution, you don&#39;t need to do all 
this above. Just send an request for the paid app. Packers team will send you a 
piece of code to include in your app. Voila You are DONE!!! Everything will be 
taken care for you including hosting, integration with payment gateway, make 
sure only paid app is run and app cannot be redistributed.&nbsp; Contact

<p>OK..Since lot of people are asking ...more details</p>
<p>There are two parts of problem:<br>
1) How to show app as paid app and let user pay<br>
2) Verify that user has paid and make sure that the apps are not distributed 
illegitimately.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="3">How to show paid app and let user pay. The are two methods of 
payment:</font><br>
1</b>) Cydia Store<br>
For that you need to contact Jay Freeman, he has to add app identifier into 
Cydia paid app list. Then the repo on which the app is hosted as to send 
appropriate tags so that Cydia can recognize it is paid app and shows as paid 
app.Cydia will handle payment.<br>
<br>
2) Your own payment method.<br>
You can have your own custom payment methods like paypal, amazon payment method, 
.... Cydia shows as free app and in the app you handle payment mechanism.<br>
<b><br>
<font size="3">Verify that user has paid and make sure that the apps are not 
distributed illegitimately.</font></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;Since there is no restriction for someone to just take the deb file &amp; make 
it available to the world. For that, there needs to be mechanism in the app to 
verify the copy is legitimate. </p>
<p>1) If the user paid for the app through Cydia Store, Cydia provides a server 
side solution to verify the app is legitimate. </p>
<p>2) If the user paid for the app through your custom provided payment method, 
you can verify either on the phone itself or on server side that the copy is 
legitimate. </p>
<p>As stated, iPhone Packers has full solution available for you. You dont need 
to worry about payment or verifying that the app is legitimate. </p>
